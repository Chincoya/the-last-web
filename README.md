# The Last Web

## The Next Web homepage clone. 

Within this repository you will find a somewhat static clone of [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/) site homepage. Responsive design with sufficient breakpoints is the main implementation goal. Addiotional constrains are the use of Flexboix and float only, avoiding grid entirely, as well as frameworks such as bootstrap.   

## Getting started

No live version was deployed so, in order to view the page, you need to clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chincoya/the-last-web.git
```

Then, you can run it in any browser that supports flexbox layout and it's properties.
